# OSD-Analysis

This combines a FASTAPI container, a postgres container with some relevant extensions inclusing POSTGIS i.e. spatial extensions
and a pgvector, along with a simple DASH application.


The key points in this app are all the fun SQLMODEL stuff needed to make PGVECTOR and POSTGIS extensions to play nicely with FASTAPI
